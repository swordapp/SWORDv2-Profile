Abstract

   The Atom Publishing Protocol [RFC5023] defines how to create a Media
   Resource by POSTing the media to a server.  It deals exclusively with
   the upload of a single file to the Media Entry, and does not make
   explicit allowances for the possibility that this file may be a
   package or bundle of other files in a particular format.  This
   specification covers extensions to the protocol to support this extra
   condition.

SWORD 002       AtomPub Extensions for Packaged COntent     January 2011


1  Introduction

   This specification defines a set of extensions to the Atom Publishing
   Protocol [RFC5023] to support the transfer and recovering of content
   packages via the standard.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2 Namespaces

   All extensions are defined within the namespace:

       http://purl.org/net/sword/

   This document uses the prefix "sword" for the namespace name.

   The AtomPub namespace is:

       http://www.w3.org/2007/app

   This document uses the prefix "app" for the namespace name.

   The Atom Syndication Format namespace is:

       http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom

   This document uses the prefix "atom" for the namespace name.

2  Service Document Extensions

   This section documents extensions to the Atom Service Document.

2.1 sword:mediation

   The sword:mediation element MUST be used to determine if a Media
   Collection will accept the deposit of content on behalf of a user
   other than the authenticated depositor.  If it is not present the
   client MUST assume that the server does not support such mediated
   deposit.

   Traditional HTTP authentication is often insufficient during package
   deposit, as it is possible that content will be delivered machine-to-
   machine and the authenticating user will be the user agent not the
   content owner.  The presence of the sword:mediation element, which

SWORD 002       AtomPub Extensions for Packaged COntent     January 2011


   MUST take a "true" or "false" value, indicates whether the On-Behalf-
   Of HTTP header [SWORD001] can be used to provide the server with a
   user other than the authenticated one who should be considered the
   actor in the transfer.

   For example:

       <service xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2007/app"
                xmlns:sword="http://purl.org/net/sword/terms/"
                xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
         <workspace>

           <atom:title>Main Site</atom:title>

           <collection href="http://www.appserver.org/col1">
             <atom:title>Collection 1</atom:title>
             <accept>*/*</accept>
             <sword:mediation>true</sword:mediation>
           </collection>

         </workspace>
       </service>

2.2 sword:acceptPackaging

   The sword:acceptPackaging element SHOULD be used to indicate to the
   user agent what package formats are acceptable to send to the server.
    If the server does not supply an element, the client MUST assume
   that the server only supports an ordinary, unstructured zip file. 
   The server MAY unzip any such files, or MAY store them as opaque
   binary files.  The sword:acceptPackaging element SHOULD contain a URI
   identifying the packaging format, but MAY contain any text string
   which can be understood by servers and user agents.

   For example:

       <service xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2007/app"
                xmlns:sword="http://purl.org/net/sword/terms/"
                xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
         <workspace>

           <atom:title>Main Site</atom:title>

           <collection href="http://www.appserver.org/col1">
             <atom:title>Collection 1</atom:title>
             <accept>*/*</accept>
             <sword:acceptPackaging>
   		http://purl.org/net/sword/package/BagIt

3 Media Entry Extensions

   This section documents extensions to the Media Entry document which
   can be retrieved from the server from the Media Entry URI.

3.1 sword:packaging

   The sword:packaging element SHOULD be used by the server to indicate
   the packaging formats that it is capable of delivering the Media
   Resource to the user agent in.  If there is no sword:packaging
   element, the user agent MUST NOT assume any packaging format; instead
   it must rely on the atom:content@type as normal, per [RFC5023].  If a
   sword:packaging element is provided the user agent MAY request the
   atom:content@src URI with the Packaging HTTP header [SWORD001]
   containing the value of the sword:packaging element.

   The value of the sword:packaging element SHOULD contain a URI
   identifying the packaging format, but MAY contain any text string
   which can be understood by servers and user agents.

   For example:

     <entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
   	 xmlns:sword="http://purl.org/net/sword/">

        <title>My Deposit</title>
        <id>info:something:1</id>

        <generator uri="http://www.appserver.org/engine" version="1.0"/>

        <content type="application/zip"
           src="http://www.appserver.org/col1/deposit1.zip"/>	
        <sword:packaging>
           http://purl.org/net/sword/package/METSDSpaceSIP
        </sword:packaging>

4 Packaged Content Delivery over HTTP with AtomPub

   A walkthrough of the process of delivering and retrieving packaged
   content with a combination of the extensions described in this
   specification and those detailed in [SWORD001].

4.1 Discovering Supported Packaging Formats for Delivery

   The user agent requests the Service Document from the server, which
   contains the sword:mediation and sword:acceptPackaging elements.  If
   the sword:mediation element is present and set to "true", this tells
   the user agent that it can use the On-Behalf-Of HTTP header
   [SWORD001] when delivering the packaged content.  The
   sword:acceptPackaging header tells the user agent what packaging
   formats it can use to deliver that content.

       <service xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2007/app"
                xmlns:sword="http://purl.org/net/sword/terms/"
                xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
         <workspace>

           <atom:title>Main Site</atom:title>

           <collection href="http://www.appserver.org/col1">
             <atom:title>Collection 1</atom:title>
             <accept>application/zip</accept>
             <sword:mediation>true</sword:mediation>
             <sword:acceptPackaging>
   	  http://purl.org/net/sword/package/BagIt
   	</sword:acceptPackaging>
           </collection>

         </workspace>
       </service>

4.2 Delivering Packaged Content

   The user agent constructs a content package which meets the criteria
   laid out in the app:accept and sword:acceptPackaging headers in the
   Service Document; for example an application/zip BagIt packaged file.
    This is delivered to the server as a standard POST of a Media
   Resource:

       POST /col1 HTTP/1.1    On-Behalf-Of: jbloggs    Packaging:

SWORD 002       AtomPub Extensions for Packaged COntent     January 2011


   http://purl.org/net/sword/package/BagIt    Content-Type:
   application/zip

   The response to this MUST be as laid out in [SWORD001]

4.3 Discovering Supported Package Formats for Retrieval

   The supported formats for retrieval are listed in the Media Entry
   document in the sword:packaging element.  The user agent can retrieve
   this document from the Media Entry URI, and discover the URI for the
   content of the Media Resource and the supported package formats.

     <entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
   	 xmlns:sword="http://purl.org/net/sword/">

        <title>My Deposit</title>
        <id>info:something:1</id>

        <updated>2008-08-18T14:27:08Z</updated>
        <author><name>jbloggs</name></author>
        <summary type="text">A summary</summary>
        <generator uri="http://www.appserver.org/engine" version="1.0"/>

        <content type="application/zip"
           src="http://www.appserver.org/col1/deposit1.zip"/>	
        <sword:packaging>
             http://purl.org/net/sword/package/BagIt
        </sword:packaging>
        <sword:packaging>
             http://purl.org/net/sword/package/METSDSpaceSIP
        </sword:packaging>

        <link rel="edit"
           href="http://www.appserver.org/col1/my_deposit.atom" />

     </entry>

   The presence of one or more sword:packaging elements tells the user
   agent that it can request the Media Resource using the Packaging HTTP
   header [SWORD001] to indicate its desired format.

4.4 Retrieving Packaged Content

   The user agent issues an HTTP GET request on the Media Resource URI
   and specifies the Packaging HTTP header [SWORD001], as follows:

       GET /col1/deposit1.zip HTTP/1.1    Packaging:
   http://purl.org/net/sword/package/BagIt

SWORD 002       AtomPub Extensions for Packaged COntent     January 2011


   The server returns the Media Resource packaged as a BagIt zip file. 
   If the server does not support the requested format it MUST respond
   as described in [SWORD001].
