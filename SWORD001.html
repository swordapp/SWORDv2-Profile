<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
   Document management systems often present a requirement to move content
   between applications and servers in groups of files and associated
   metadata.  HTTP and AtomPub protocols provide a good match for this
   requirement, but do not make certain information easily available to the
   systems exchanging data.
   This specification describes HTTP headers to
   enhance the delivery of packaged content over HTTP to document
   servers and similar systems from client software, and authority information 
   relating to that transfer.
</p>

<p>
The specification has been informed by the JISC funded SWORD series of projects to develop 
deposit technology for repository systems.  A first version of SWORD addressed simple one-time
fire-and-forget transfer of packaged content from a client environment to a repository.
Subsequently, the need to fully support CRUD against stuch repositories and other scholarly
systems has become evident, and the HTTP headers presented here have been derived from a 
detailed requirements analysis of the sector.
</p>

<p>
During the requirements analysis, existing internet standards were considered.  In particular
the possibility of extending the existing Accept headers, or the use of Media Features were 
considered in detail, and found to either not be sufficiently flexible or to offer a 
degree of complexity to the work which was unnecessary.
</p>

<h3>1.1 Introduction to Packaging</h3>

<p>
"Packaging" in the context of this document refers to resources delivered over
HTTP which are comprised of component resources.  For example, a ZIP file containing multiple
files can be considered a "package".  Further, some ZIP files have a well defined internal 
structure which is not accurately portrayed by the <span class="code_inline">Content-Type</span>
header (which would usually be application/zip).  
</p>

<p>
The aim of this specification is to enable the client and server to talk meaningfully about
those packaged, compound objects
</p>

<h2>2. Notational Conventions</h2>

<p>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="#rfc2119">RFC2119</a>].
</p>

<p>
   The version of BNF used in this document is taken from [<a href="#rfc2616">RFC2616</a>], and
   many of the nonterminals used are defined there.  Note that the
   underlying charset is US-ASCII.
</p>


<h2>3. Packaging</h2>

<p>
The <span class="code_inline">Packaging</span> header applies to resources delivered over
HTTP which are comprised of component resources, and is for uniquely identifying these well structured 
packaged objects in a similar way that <span class="code_inline">Content-Type</span> does for
MIME formats.
</p>

<p>
   The <span class="code_inline">Packaging</span> header is constructed as follows:
</p>

<div class="code">
   	Packaging = "Packaging" ":" absoluteURI
</div>

<p>
   Note that <span class="code_inline">absoluteURI</span> is defined in
   [<a href="#rfc2616">RFC2616</a>].
</p>

<p>
   For example:
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
POST /collection HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Content-Type: application/zip
Content-Length: [content length]
Content-MD5: [md5-digest]
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=[filename]
Slug: [suggested identifier]
Packaging: http://purl.org/net/terms/package/default

[request entity]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
   The <span class="code_inline">Packaging</span> request header SHOULD be used by the client during
   HTTP POST to give information to the server about the packaging
   format used to construct the content being POSTed or PUT.  Servers
   SHOULD use this information to unpack the supplied content into its
   component parts.  If the server does not understand the package
   format it MUST either store the content as delivered without
   unpacking or respond with <span class="code_inline">415</span> (Unsupported Media Type).
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code_inline">Packaging</span> request header MUST contain a
    URI.  At this point there is no registry of allowed URIs.  MIME media types are
    not permitted in this field, and if a MIME media type exists to describe the
    packaging format, it SHOULD be used in the corresponding <span class="code_inline">
    Content-Type</span> header.
</p>


<h2>4. Accept-Packaging</h2>

<p>
The <span class="code_inline">Accept-Packaging</span> header applies to resources retrieved over
HTTP which are comprised of component resources, and is for requesting these well structured packaged 
objects from a server.  It should be considered
similar to the standard <span class="code_inline">Accept</span> headers provided by HTTP, but 
it currently only takes a single string, and does not support q values.
</p>

<p>
   The <span class="code_inline">Accept-Packaging</span> header is constructed as follows:
</p>

<div class="code">
   	Accept-Packaging = "Accept-Packaging" ":" absoluteURI
 </div>

<p>
   Note that <span class="code_inline">absoluteURI</span> is defined in
   [<a href="#rfc2616">RFC2616</a>].
</p>

<p>
   For example:
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
GET /item/27 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Accept-Packaging: http://purl.org/net/terms/package/default
</pre>
</div>

<p>
   The <span class="code_inline">Accept-Packaging</span> request header SHOULD be used by the client
   during HTTP GET to indicate to the server the package format that the
   content identified by the URI should be returned in.  Servers MUST
   either return the content in the specified format or return a <span class="code_inline">406 Not
   Acceptable</span>.
</p>


<h2>5. On-Behalf-Of</h2>

<p>
   The <span class="code_inline">On-Behalf-Of</span> request header MAY be used by the client to
   alert the server as to the identity of the true owner of the content
   during PUT, POST, DELETE and GET.  Traditional HTTP authentication is
   insufficient in this regard as it is possible that content will be
   delivered machine-to-machine and the authenticating user will be the
   client not the content owner.  Servers SHOULD use this
   information to determine whether and how they accept the content.
</p>

<div class="code">
   	On-Behalf-Of = "On-Behalf-Of" ":" (token | quoted-string)
</div>

<p>
   For example:
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
POST /collection HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Authorization: [auth]
Content-Type: application/zip
Content-Length: [content length]
Content-MD5: [md5-digest]
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=[filename]
Slug: [suggested identifier]
Packaging: http://purl.org/net/terms/package/default
On-Behalf-Of: jbloggs

[request entity]
</pre>
</div>


<h2>6. In-Progress</h2>

<p>
   The <span class="code_inline">In-Progress</span> request header MAY be used by the client to
   inform the server that the current content payload is not yet
   complete in some unspecified way during PUT, POST or DELETE.  For
   example, there may by further content packages that the client
   plans to deliver to the server before the full content has been
   delivered, or the client may need to carry out other actions
   against the server before confirming that the server can proceed to
   fully process the content.  Exact interpretation of this header is
   left to the server, so it is necessary that server/client pairs will
   have to have a common understanding of its meaning which is beyond
   the scope of this document.
</p>

<div class="code">
   	In-Progress = "In-Progress" ":" ("true" | "false")
</div>

<p>
   For example:
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
POST /collection HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Authorization: Basic ZGFmZnk6c2VjZXJldA==
Content-Type: application/zip
Content-Length: [content length]
Content-MD5: [md5-digest]
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=[filename]
Slug: [suggested identifier]
Packaging: http://purl.org/net/terms/package/default
On-Behalf-Of: jbloggs
In-Progress: true

[request entity]
</pre>
</div>

<h2>7. Metadata-Relevant</h2>

<p>
   The <span class="code_inline">Metadata-Relevant</span> request header MAY be used by the client to
   instruct the server to (attempt to) extract metadata from the
   supplied content package, during PUT, POST or DELETE.  Content
   packages commonly contain both file content and metadata about its
   contents, and during unpacking servers may process this metadata in a
   way which is meaningful to them.  If the content package is being 
   supplied to an HTTP resource which is not interested in metadata, then it may be that the
   enclosed information will not be correctly or adequately treated.  This
   directive allows the client to indicate to the server that there is metadata
   contained within the package which may be of interest to related resources (for
   example a resource which contains the resource receiving the content),
   and that the server should be free to update those resources accordingly.
   
</p>

<div class="code">
   	Metadata-Relevant = "Metadata-Relevant" ":" ("true" | "false")
</div>

<p>
   For example:
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
POST /media-resource/27 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Authorization: [auth]
Content-Type: application/zip
Content-Length: [content length]
Content-MD5: [md5-digest]
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=[filename]
Slug: [suggested identifier]
Packaging: http://purl.org/net/terms/package/default
On-Behalf-Of: jbloggs
In-Progress: true
Metadata-Relevant: false

[request entity]
</pre>
</div>
