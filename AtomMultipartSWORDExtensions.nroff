Abstract

The AtomPub Multipart Media Resource Creation Internet Draft [AtomMultipart] defines how an Atom Publishing Protocol collection may process multipart/related requests and how a service announces that it accepts multipart/related entities.  This document adds a short additional extension to that draft for supporting the delivery of packaged content in the same way.

This section documents extensions to the Multipart Representations of the deposit.

Further to the requirements laid out in [AtomMultipart] the Entry Part MUST include a Content-Disposition header of type "attachment" and name parameter of "atom":

	Content-Disposition: attachment; name=atom

The Media Part MUST include a Content-Disposition header of type "attachment" and name parameter of "payload".  It MAY also include a filename parameter:

	Content-Disposition: attachment; name=payload; filename=example.zip

The Media Part MAY supply a Packaging header [SWORD001] providing the URI (or other allowed) of the packaging format used in the payload.
