Abstract

   Often in information systems there is a requirement to move content
   between applications and servers in groups of files and associated
   metadata.  This document describes HTTP Headers and Media Features to
   aid this process over HTTP.

1  Introduction

   This specification describes HTTP headers and Media Features to
   enhance the delivery of packaged content over HTTP to document
   servers and similar systems from client software.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2 Notation

   The version of BNF used in this document is taken from [RFC2068], and
   many of the nonterminals used are defined there.  Note that the
   underlying charset is US-ASCII.

2  Packaging

   The Packaging header is constructed as follows:

   	Packaging = "Packaging" ":" packaging-expression

   	packaging-expression = token | quoted-string | absoluteURI

   Note that token, quoted-string and absoluteURI are defined in
   [RFC2068].

   For example:

   	Packaging: http://purl.org/net/terms/package/default

   The Packaging request header SHOULD be used by the user agent during
   HTTP POST to give information to the server about the packaging
   format used to construct the content being POSTed or PUT.  Servers
   SHOULD use this information to unpack the supplied content into its
   component parts.  If the server does not understand the package
   format it MUST either store the content as delivered without
   unpacking or respond with 415 (Unsupported Media Type).

3 Accept-Packaging

   The Accept-Packaging header is constructed as follows:

   	Accept-Packaging = "Accept-Packaging" ":" packaging-expression

   	packaging-expression = token | quoted-string | absoluteURI

   Note that token, quoted-string and absoluteURI are defined in
   [RFC2068].

   For example:

   	Accept-Packaging: http://purl.org/net/terms/package/default

   The Accept-Packaging request header SHOULD be used by the user agent
   during HTTP GET to indicate to the server the package format that the
   content identified by the URI should be returned in.  Servers MUST
   either return the content in the specified format or return a 406 Not
   Acceptable.

4 On-Behalf-Of

   The On-Behalf-Of request header MAY be used by the user agent to
   alert the server as to the identity of the true owner of the content
   during PUT, POST, DELETE and GET.  Traditional HTTP authentication is
   insufficient in this regard as it is possible that content will be
   delivered machine-to-machine and the authenticating user will be the
   user agent not the content owner.  Servers SHOULD use this
   information to determine whether and how they accept the content.

   	On-Behalf-Of = "On-Behalf-Of" ":" (token | quoted-string)

   For example:

   	Authorization: Basic [digested auth information for user agent]

   	On-Behalf-Of: jbloggs

5 In-Progress

   The In-Progress request header MAY be used by the user agent to
   inform the server that the current content payload is not yet
   complete in some unspecified way during PUT, POST or DELETE.  For
   example, there may by further content packages that the user agent
   plans to deliver to the server before the full content has been
   delivered, or the user agent may need to carry out other actions
   against the server before confirming that the server can proceed to
   fully process the content.  Exact interpretation of this header is
   left to the server, so it is necessary that server/client pairs will
   have to have a common understanding of its meaning which is beyond
   the scope of this document.

   	In-Progress = "In-Progress" ":" ("true" | "false")

6 Suppress-Metadata

SWORD 001              Packaged Content Delivery            January 2011


   The Suppress-Metadata request header MAY be used by the user agent to
   instruct the server not to attempt to extract metadata from the
   supplied content package, during PUT, POST or DELETE.  Content
   packages commonly contain both file content and metadata about its
   contents, and during unpacking servers may process this metadata in a
   way which is meaningful to them.  This directive allows the user
   agent to suppress that behaviour for its own purposes.  Furthermore,
   a DELETE operation may be requested which removes content previously
   delivered from the server, and in this case the header instructs the
   server to retain a copy of the metadata while deleting the content.

   	Suppress-Metadata = "Suppress-Metadata" ":" ("true" | "false")

7  Security Considerations

   This document is based on HTTP and thus subject to the security
   considerations found in Section 15 of [RFC2068].


8  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies 5 new message headers which conform to the
   registry mechanism for provisional message headers in [RFC3864] and
   one new media feature which conforms to the URI tree registry
   mechanism in [RFC2506].
