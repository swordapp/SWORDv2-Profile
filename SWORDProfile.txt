SWORD Profile version 2.0

1.  Introduction

The Atom Publishing Protocol ([AtomPub]) provides a simple, extensible mechanism for the creation of Web Resources. The
SWORD profile builds upon AtomPub and HTTP ([RFCxxxx]) and incorporates a number of extensions to enable the following
kinds of behaviours:

* Clients may create resources by sending compound resources, such as archive files (tar, zip).
* Both non-interactive and 3rd party mediated operation are required.
* Workflows may or may not include manual stages before deposited resources become available as web resources.
* Clients may update or delete parts of the compound resources or associated metadata
* Clients may display the state and actual server description of deposited resources to users

The practical details of the extensions used in the SWORD Profile are provided in the following Internet Drafts:

* Packaged Content Delivery over HTTP [SWORD001]
* AtomPub Extensions for Packaged Content [SWORD002]
* AtomPub Extensions for SWORD [SWORD003]
* Atom Multipart Extensions for Packaged Content [SWORD004]
* SWORD Package Registry [SWORD005]

2.  Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. Terminology

Throughout this document we will regularly refer to identifiers which are used by SWORD.  The following URIs are part
of the specification:

SD-URI - The service document URI. This is the URI from which the root service document can be located. If the server
supports nesting of service documents, then these sub-service documents are also subject to the same rules as SD-URI
and should be considered the same.

Col-URI - The URI of a SWORD Collection. This is the URI to which the initial deposit will take place, and which are
listed in the service document.

Cont-URI - The Content URI. This is the URI from which the client will be able to retrieve representations of the
object as it resides in the SWORD server (which representation is returned will be through content negotiation, as
discussed later).

EM-URI - The Atom Edit Media URI. This is almost always going to be the same as the Cont-URI, but the Atom spec requires
that these identifiers be allowed to differ.  Throughout this document we will mostly refer to the EM-URI.  An important
thing to note about the EM-URI and the Cont-URI is that they do not refer to the resource as deposited by the client
(e.g. the original zip), but to all the content stored in the item on the server, and the format that this URI returns
is obtained by content negotiation.  This will be discussed in more detail in the Deposit Receipt section.

Edit-URI - The Atom Media Edit URI. This is the URI of the Atom Entry, and therefore also of the container within the
SWORD server.

State-URI - The SWORD Statement URI.  This is one of the URIs which can be used to retrieve a description of the object
from the sword server, including the structure of the object and its state.

4.  Namespaces

4.1.    SWORD Namespaces

All SWORD extensions are defined within the namespace:

    http://purl.org/net/sword/

Beneath this URI, we use the following extensions for the various parts of the standard:

    http://purl.org/net/sword/terms/

Root registry for any SWORD recognised package formats including "default":
    http://purl.org/net/sword/package/

Root namespace for any Error documents which SWORD can produce:
    http://purl.org/net/sword/error/

Root namespace for any State terms that SWORD wishes to provide:
    http://purl.org/net/sword/state/

This document uses the prefix "sword" for the namespace name.

5.  URIs

The default packaging format, which represents a plain ZIP file during resource creation or update, or a ZIP file +
Atom embedded DC metadata during Atom Multipart [AtomMultipart] deposit

    http://purl.org/net/sword/package/default

The packaging format which represents a binary file which should not be unpacked by the server

    http://purl.org/net/sword/package/binary


6.  Protocol Operations

While specific HTTP status codes are used below, a SWORD client should be prepared to handle any status code as per the
HTTP status code definitions [RDFxxxx]

6.1 Retrieving a Service Document

See Section 5.1 and 8 of [AtomPub], for details.

The client may also supply the On-Behalf-Of header [SWORD001] to provide the username of a target user on whose behalf
a deposit will be made.

    GET SD-URI HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic ZGFmZnk6c2VjZXJldA==
    On-Behalf-Of: [username]

When a server that supports mediated deposit receives an On-Behalf-Of header [SWORD001], the returned Service Document SHOULD
identify only those collections to which the combination of mediated user and authenticated user might successfully
deposit. If the target server does not support mediated deposit, the returned Service Document SHOULD contain a
sword:mediation [SWORD002] extension element with a value of false.

The service document supplied in response must meet the following criteria in addition to those specified in [AtomPub]:

* MUST specify the sword:version element with a value of 2.0 [SWORD003]
* MAY specify the sword:maxUploadSize [SWORD003]
* MUST specify the app:accept element.  If the Collection can take any format content type, it should specify "*/*" as
its value [AtomPub]
* MAY include sword:collectionPolicy [SWORD003]
* SHOULD include a sword:mediation element with a value of true or false [SWORD002]
* MAY include a sword:treatment element [SWORD003]
* MAY include zero or more sword:acceptPackaging elements [SWORD002].  The value SHOULD be a URI for a known packaging
format (where such URIs exist).
* MAY include zero or more sword:service [SWORD003] elements containing references to nested service descriptions

Example:

    HTTP 1.1  200 OK
    Content-Type: text/xml

    <service xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/"
             xmlns:sword="http://purl.org/net/sword/terms/"
             xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
             xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">

      <sword:version>2.0</sword:version>
      <sword:maxUploadSize>16777216</sword:maxUploadSize>

      <workspace>
        <atom:title>Main Site</atom:title>

        <collection href="http://localhost:8080/col-uri/43baf931-d6a0-4da3-8f17-ae6e5efc812b">
          <atom:title>Collection 43baf931-d6a0-4da3-8f17-ae6e5efc812b</atom:title>

          <sword:mediation>false</sword:mediation>
          <sword:treatment>Treatment description</sword:treatment>
          <sword:acceptPackaging>http://purl.org/net/sword/package/default</sword:acceptPackaging>
          <sword:acceptPackaging>http://purl.org/net/sword/package/METSDSpaceSIP</sword:acceptPackaging>
          <sword:service>http://localhost:8080/sd-uri/e406cadd-1be5-44cc-8e78-3b8b7e867ea2</sword:service>
        </collection>

      </workspace>

    </service>


6.2 Listing Collections

See Section 5.2 of [AtomPub] for details.

AtomPub states that Collection Resources MUST provide representations in the form of Atom Feed Documents.
Under the SWORD profile, implementations SHOULD provide such representations. Clients MUST NOT require a Collection
Feed Document for deposit operation.


6.3 Creating a Resource

6.3.1   Creating a Resource with a Binary File Deposit

See Sections 5.3 and 9.2 of [AtomPub] for details.  

The client can create a resource by POSTing the binary content as the body of an HTTP request, with the Content-Type,
Content-Disposition, and Packaging headers, with the following requirements:

* the client SHOULD supply a Content-Type header
* the client MUST supply a Content-Disposition header with a filename parameter
* the client SHOULD supply a Content-MD5 header with the MD5 checksum hex encoded for the binary content
* the client SHOULD supply a Packaging header [SWORD001] providing the URI (or other allowed) of the packaging format used
* the client MAY provide an In-Progress header with a value of "true" or "false" [SWORD001]
* the client MAY provide an On-Behalf-Of header [SWORD001]
* the client MAY provide a Suppress-Metadata header [SWORD001]
* the client MAY supply a Slug header providing a suggested identifier for the deposited content

    POST Col-URI HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/zip
    Authorization: Basic ZGFmZnk6c2VjZXJldA==
    Content-Length: nnn
    Content-MD5: [md5-digest]
    Content-Disposition: filename=[filename]
    Packaging: http://purl.org/net/sword/package/METSDSpaceSIP
    In-Progress: true
    On-Behalf-Of: jbloggs
    Suppress-Metadata: true
    Slug: [suggested identifier]

    [request entity]

The requirements placed on the server here are:

* if no Content-Type header is supplied the server MUST behave as per Section 7.2.1 in [RFC2616]
* The server SHOULD verify the Content-MD5 header against the content.  If the check fails, the server MUST respond with
412 Precondition Failed.  See Section XXXX on Error Documents.
* Server implementations MUST adopt the behaviour and requirements in [RFC2183] with respect to the Content-Disposition
header
* If there is no Packaging header, the server MUST assume that it is the default packaging format
(http://purl.org/net/sword/package/default)
* Server implementations MUST adopt the behaviour and requirements in Section 9.7 of [AtomPub] with respect to the
Slug header
* If there is no In-Progress header, the server MUST assume that it is "false", and MUST behave as described in
Section XXXX: Continued Deposit
* If there is an On-Behalf-Of header, the server MUST behave as described in Section XXX: Mediated Deposit
* If there is no Suppress-Metadata header, the server MUST assume that it is "false", and MUST behave as described in
Section XXXX: Metadata Handling
* The server MUST create a new resource containing content equivalent to or derived from the deposited content, or
return an error document.

Once the server has processed the request it SHOULD return a Deposit Receipt as described in Section XXX: Deposit Receipt
with the HTTP status code 201 (Created) if the server has completed the deposit of the resource of 202 (Accepted) if
the server has accepted the resource but still has deposit workflows to run before finally accepting it.  The Deposit
Receipt MUST be available under the Edit-URI (Member Entry URI), as supplied in the Location header.

For example:

    201 Created
    Location: [Edit-URI]

    [optional Deposit Receipt]

6.3.2   Creating a Resource with a Multipart Deposit

See [AtomMultipart] for details.

In order to ensure that all SWORD clients and servers can exchange a full range of file content and metadata, the use
of Atom Multipart [AtomMultipart] is permitted to combine a default package with a set of Dublin Core metadata terms
embedded in an Atom Entry.

The client can crete a resource by POSTing a multipart mime message to the server with two parts: An Atom Entry
containing the metadata for the deposit, and the binary content as the second part, with the following requirements:

* the client MUST comply with the rules laid out in [AtomMultipart]
* the client MUST supply a Content-Disposition header on the first (atom) part with a "name" parameter set to "atom" [SWORD004]
* the client MUST supply a Content-Disposition header on the second (binary) part with a "name" parameter set to "payload"
and a filename parameter [SWORD004]
* the client SHOULD supply a Content-MD5 header with the MD5 checksum hex encoded for the binary content on the second
(binary) part
* the client SHOULD supply a Packaging header [SWORD001] providing the URI (or other allowed) of the packaging format used
on the second (binary) part
* the client MAY provide an In-Progress header with a value of "true" or "false" [SWORD001] on the main HTTP header
* the client MAY provide an On-Behalf-Of header [SWORD001] on the main HTTP header
* the client MAY provide a Suppress-Metadata header [SWORD001] on the main HTTP header
* the client MAY supply a Slug header providing a suggested identifier for the deposited content on the main HTTP header
* the client MAY add Dublin Core [DublinCore] terms to the Entry as foreign markup; the terms MUST be embedded as
direct children of the atom:entry element.
* the client MAY add any other metadata format to the atom:entry element

    POST Col-URI HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic ZGFmZnk6c2VjZXJldA==
    Content-Length: nnn
    Content-Type: multipart/related;
          boundary="===============1605871705==";

    ...binary package data...
    --===============1605871705==--

The requirements placed on the server here are:

* The server SHOULD verify the Content-MD5 header against the binary content.  If the check fails, the server MUST respond with
412 Precondition Failed.  See Section XXXX on Error Documents.
* Server implementations MUST adopt the behaviour and requirements in [RFC2183] with respect to the Content-Disposition
header for the binary content
* If there is no Packaging header on the binary part, the server MUST assume that it is the default packaging format
(http://purl.org/net/sword/package/default)
* Server implementations MUST adopt the behaviour and requirements in Section 9.7 of [AtomPub] with respect to the
Slug header
* If there is no In-Progress header, the server MUST assume that it is "false", and MUST behave as described in
Section XXXX: Continued Deposit
* If there is an On-Behalf-Of header, the server MUST behave as described in Section XXX: Mediated Deposit
* If there is no Suppress-Metadata header, the server MUST assume that it is "false", and MUST behave as described in
Section XXXX: Metadata Handling
* The server MUST create a new resource containing content equivalent to or derived from the deposited content, or
return an error document.
* The server MUST be able to interpret the Dublin Core foreign markup in the atom:entry element, but MAY NOT understand
any other embedded formats.

Once the server has processed the request it SHOULD return a Deposit Receipt as described in Section XXX: Deposit Receipt
with the HTTP status code 201 (Created) if the server has completed the deposit of the resource of 202 (Accepted) if
the server has accepted the resource but still has deposit workflows to run before finally accepting it.  The Deposit
Receipt MUST be available under the Edit-URI (Member Entry URI), as supplied in the Location header.

For example:

    201 Created
    Location: [Edit-URI]

    [optional Deposit Receipt]

6.4 Retrieving the content

See section 5.4 of [AtomPub] for details.

The Deposit Receipt contains two URIs which can be used to retrieve content from the server: Cont-URI and EM-URI.  These
are provided in the atom:content@src element and the atom:link@rel="edit-media" elements respectively.  Their only
functional difference is that you are MUST NOT carry out any HTTP operations other than GET on the Cont-URI, while all
operations are permitted on the EM-URI.  It is acceptable for both URIs to be the same, and in this section we refer
only to the EM-URI but in all cases it can be substituted for the Cont-URI.

The Deposit Receipt contains zero or more sword:packaging elements [SWORD002], indicating to the client what package
formats can be retrieved from the server.  For example:

<entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
        xmlns:sword="http://purl.org/net/sword/">

    [...]

    <content type="application/zip"
        src="http://www.sss.ac.uk/geography-collection/my_deposit"/>
    <link rel="edit-media"
        href="http://www.sss.ac.uk/geography-collection/my_deposit"/>

    <sword:packaging>http://purl.org/net/sword/package/default</sword:packaging>
    <sword:packaging>http://purl.org/net/sword/package/METSDSpaceSIP</sword:packaging>
    <sword:packaging>http://purl.org/net/sword/package/BagIt</sword:packaging>
        
</entry>

To retrieve the content in the desired packaging format, the client makes an HTTP GET request to the EM-URI and MAY
supply a Packaging header [SWORD001] with the URI from one of the sword:packaging elements.

The server will respond in different ways depending on a number of conditions:

* If the Packaging header is not supplied, the server SHOULD assume the default packaging format
(http://purl.org/net/sword/package/default), but MAY elect another format if it wishes.  The server MUST then
supply the client with a package which meets these specifications.
* If the Packaging header is supplied, and contains the URI (or other allowed value) of a format that the server
supports, the server MUST then supply the client with a package which meets these specifications.
* If the Packaging header is supplied but contains a URI (or other allowed value) for a format that the server does
not support, the server MUST respond with 406 Not Acceptable and MAY include an error document as per Section XXX:
Error Documents.

For more details about the packaging process, see Section XXX: Packaging


6.4 Editing the Content of a Resource

See section 5.4 and 9.3 of [AtomPub] for details.

The client can replace the existing content of a resource by performing an HTTP PUT of some new binary content to the
EM-URI, with the following requirements:

* the client SHOULD supply a Content-Type header
* the client MUST supply a Content-Disposition header with a filename parameter
* the client SHOULD supply a Content-MD5 header with the MD5 checksum hex encoded for the binary content
* the client SHOULD supply a Packaging header [SWORD001] providing the URI (or other allowed) of the packaging format used
* the client MAY provide an In-Progress header with a value of "true" or "false" [SWORD001]
* the client MAY provide an On-Behalf-Of header [SWORD001]
* the client MAY provide a Suppress-Metadata header [SWORD001]

    POST EM-URI HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/zip
    Authorization: Basic ZGFmZnk6c2VjZXJldA==
    Content-Length: nnn
    Content-MD5: [md5-digest]
    Content-Disposition: filename=[filename]
    Packaging: http://purl.org/net/sword/package/METSDSpaceSIP
    In-Progress: true
    On-Behalf-Of: jbloggs
    Suppress-Metadata: true

    [request entity]

The requirements placed on the server here are:

* The server SHOULD verify the Content-MD5 header against the content.  If the check fails, the server MUST respond with
412 Precondition Failed.  See Section XXXX on Error Documents.
* Server implementations MUST adopt the behaviour and requirements in [RFC2183] with respect to the Content-Disposition
header
* If there is no Packaging header, the server MUST assume that it is the default packaging format
(http://purl.org/net/sword/package/default)
* If there is no In-Progress header, the server MUST assume that it is "false", and MUST behave as described in
Section XXXX: Continued Deposit
* If there is an On-Behalf-Of header, the server MUST behave as described in Section XXX: Mediated Deposit
* If there is no Suppress-Metadata header, the server MUST assume that it is "false", and MUST behave as described in
Section XXXX: Metadata Handling
* The server MUST effectively replace all the existing content in the item (subject to the rules associated with Metadata
Handling), although implementations may choose to provide versioning or some other mechanism for retaining the
overwritten content.

Once the server has processed the request it SHOULD return a Deposit Receipt as described in Section XXX: Deposit Receipt
with the HTTP status code 200 (OK) if the server has completed the deposit of the resource or 202 (Accepted) if
the server has accepted the resource but still has deposit workflows to run before finally accepting it.  The Deposit
Receipt MUST be available under the Edit-URI (Member Entry URI), as supplied in the Location header.

For example:

    200 OK
    Location: [Edit-URI]

    [optional Deposit Receipt]


6.5 Deleting the Content of a Resource

See Sections 5.4 and 9.4 of [AtomPub] for details.

The client can remove all the content of a resource without removing the resource itself by issuing an HTTP DELETE
request on the EM-URI, with the following requirements:

* the client MAY provide an In-Progress header with a value of "true" or "false" [SWORD001]
* the client MAY provide an On-Behalf-Of header [SWORD001]
* the client MAY provide a Suppress-Metadata header [SWORD001]

    DELETE EM-URI HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic ZGFmZnk6c2VjZXJldA==
    In-Progress: true
    On-Behalf-Of: jbloggs
    Suppress-Metadata: true

The requirements placed on the server here are:

* If there is no In-Progress header, the server MUST assume that it is "false", and MUST behave as described in
Section XXXX: Continued Deposit
* If there is an On-Behalf-Of header, the server MUST behave as described in Section XXX: Mediated Deposit
* If there is no Suppress-Metadata header, the server MUST assume that it is "false", and MUST behave as described in
Section XXXX: Metadata Handling
* The server MUST effectively delete all the existing content in the item (subject to the rules associated with Metadata
Handling), although implementations may choose to provide versioning or some other mechanism for retaining the
deleted content.

Once the server has processed the request it SHOULD return a Deposit Receipt as described in Section XXX: Deposit Receipt
with the HTTP status code 200 (OK) if the server has completed the delete of the content or 202 (Accepted) if
the server has accepted the delete request but still has deposit workflows to run before finally accepting it.  The Deposit
Receipt MUST be available under the Edit-URI (Member Entry URI), as supplied in the Location header.

For example:

    200 OK
    Location: [Edit-URI]

    [optional Deposit Receipt]

6.6 Adding Content to a Resource

6.6.1   Adding New Packages or Files to a Container

The client can add further packaged or binary content to a container, adding to existing content rather than overwriting,
by issuing an HTTP POST to the Edit-URI, with the following requirements:

* the client SHOULD supply a Content-Type header
* the client MUST supply a Content-Disposition header with a filename parameter
* the client SHOULD supply a Content-MD5 header with the MD5 checksum hex encoded for the binary content
* the client SHOULD supply a Packaging header [SWORD001] providing the URI (or other allowed) of the packaging format used
* the client MAY provide an In-Progress header with a value of "true" or "false" [SWORD001]
* the client MAY provide an On-Behalf-Of header [SWORD001]
* the client MAY provide a Suppress-Metadata header [SWORD001]

    POST Edit-URI HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/zip
    Authorization: Basic ZGFmZnk6c2VjZXJldA==
    Content-Length: nnn
    Content-MD5: [md5-digest]
    Content-Disposition: filename=[filename]
    Packaging: http://purl.org/net/sword/package/METSDSpaceSIP
    In-Progress: true
    On-Behalf-Of: jbloggs
    Suppress-Metadata: true

    [request entity]

The requirements placed on the server here are:

* The server SHOULD verify the Content-MD5 header against the content.  If the check fails, the server MUST respond with
412 Precondition Failed.  See Section XXXX on Error Documents.
* Server implementations MUST adopt the behaviour and requirements in [RFC2183] with respect to the Content-Disposition
header
* If there is no Packaging header, the server MUST assume that it is the default packaging format
(http://purl.org/net/sword/package/default)
* If there is no In-Progress header, the server MUST assume that it is "false", and MUST behave as described in
Section XXXX: Continued Deposit
* If there is an On-Behalf-Of header, the server MUST behave as described in Section XXX: Mediated Deposit
* If there is no Suppress-Metadata header, the server MUST assume that it is "false", and MUST behave as described in
Section XXXX: Metadata Handling
* The server SHOULD NOT overwrite any existing content, and MUST add content equivalent to or derived from the deposited
content to the existing container or respond with an error document.

Once the server has processed the request it SHOULD return a Deposit Receipt as described in Section XXX: Deposit Receipt
with the HTTP status code 200 (OK) if the server has completed the deposit of the resource or 202 (Accepted) if
the server has accepted the resource but still has deposit workflows to run before finally accepting it.  The Deposit
Receipt MUST be available under the Edit-URI (Member Entry URI), as supplied in the Location header.

For example:

    200 OK
    Location: [Edit-URI]

    [optional Deposit Receipt]

6.6.2   Adding New Metadata to a Resource

The client can update the metadata attached to a resource by issuing an HTTP POST of a new Atom Entry document
containing metadata embedded as foreign markup, with the following requirements:

* the client MUST supply a Content-Type header with the value "application/atom+xml" or "application/atom+xml;type=entry"
* the client MAY provide an In-Progress header with a value of "true" or "false" [SWORD001]
* the client MAY provide an On-Behalf-Of header [SWORD001]
* the client MAY provide a Suppress-Metadata header [SWORD001]
* the client MAY add Dublin Core [DublinCore] terms to the Entry as foreign markup; the terms MUST be embedded as
direct children of the atom:entry element.
* the client MAY add any other metadata format to the atom:entry element

    POST Edit-URI HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/atom+xml;type=entry
    Authorization: Basic ZGFmZnk6c2VjZXJldA==
    Content-Length: nnn
    In-Progress: true
    On-Behalf-Of: jbloggs
    Suppress-Metadata: true

    [entry document]

The requirements placed on the server here are:

* If there is no In-Progress header, the server MUST assume that it is "false", and MUST behave as described in
Section XXXX: Continued Deposit
* If there is an On-Behalf-Of header, the server MUST behave as described in Section XXX: Mediated Deposit
* If there is no Suppress-Metadata header, the server MUST assume that it is "false", and MUST behave as described in
Section XXXX: Metadata Handling
* The server MUST be able to interpret the Dublin Core foreign markup in the atom:entry element, but MAY NOT understand
any other embedded formats.

Once the server has processed the request it SHOULD return a Deposit Receipt as described in Section XXX: Deposit Receipt
with the HTTP status code 200 (OK) if the server has completed the deposit of the resource or 202 (Accepted) if
the server has accepted the resource but still has deposit workflows to run before finally accepting it.  The Deposit
Receipt MUST be available under the Edit-URI (Member Entry URI), as supplied in the Location header.

For example:

    200 OK
    Location: [Edit-URI]

    [optional Deposit Receipt]

6.6.3   Adding New Metadata and Packages or Files to a Resource with Multipart

The client can add new content and update the metadata attached to a resource by issuing an HTTP POST of an Atom
Multipart [AtomMultipart] document, with the following requirements:

* the client MUST comply with the rules laid out in [AtomMultipart]
* the client MUST supply a Content-Disposition header on the first (atom) part with a "name" parameter set to "atom" [SWORD004]
* the client MUST supply a Content-Disposition header on the second (binary) part with a "name" parameter set to "payload"
and a filename parameter [SWORD004]
* the client SHOULD supply a Content-MD5 header with the MD5 checksum hex encoded for the binary content on the second
(binary) part
* the client SHOULD supply a Packaging header [SWORD001] providing the URI (or other allowed) of the packaging format used
on the second (binary) part
* the client MAY provide an In-Progress header with a value of "true" or "false" [SWORD001] on the main HTTP header

    ...binary package data...
    --===============1605871705==--

The requirements placed on the server here are:

* The server SHOULD verify the Content-MD5 header against the binary content.  If the check fails, the server MUST respond with
412 Precondition Failed.  See Section XXXX on Error Documents.
* Server implementations MUST adopt the behaviour and requirements in [RFC2183] with respect to the Content-Disposition
header for the binary content
* If there is no Packaging header on the binary part, the server MUST assume that it is the default packaging format
(http://purl.org/net/sword/package/default)
* Server implementations MUST adopt the behaviour and requirements in Section 9.7 of [AtomPub] with respect to the
Slug header
* If there is no In-Progress header, the server MUST assume that it is "false", and MUST behave as described in
Section XXXX: Continued Deposit
* If there is an On-Behalf-Of header, the server MUST behave as described in Section XXX: Mediated Deposit
* If there is no Suppress-Metadata header, the server MUST assume that it is "false", and MUST behave as described in
Section XXXX: Metadata Handling
* The server MUST be able to interpret the Dublin Core foreign markup in the atom:entry element, but MAY NOT understand
any other embedded formats.

Once the server has processed the request it SHOULD return a Deposit Receipt as described in Section XXX: Deposit Receipt
with the HTTP status code 201 (Created) if the server has completed the deposit of the resource of 202 (Accepted) if
the server has accepted the resource but still has deposit workflows to run before finally accepting it.  The Deposit
Receipt MUST be available under the Edit-URI (Member Entry URI), as supplied in the Location header.

For example:

    201 Created
    Location: [Edit-URI]

    [optional Deposit Receipt]


6.7 Delete the Container

The client can delete the entire object on the server by issuing an HTTP DELETE request on the Edit-URI, with the
following requirements:

* the client MAY provide an On-Behalf-Of header [SWORD001]

    DELETE Edit-URI HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic ZGFmZnk6c2VjZXJldA==
    On-Behalf-Of: jbloggs

The requirements placed on the server here are:

* If there is an On-Behalf-Of header, the server MUST behave as described in Section XXX: Mediated Deposit
* The server MUST effectively remove the Container and all its content, although implementations may choose to provide
versioning or some other mechanism for retaining the deleted content.
* The Edit-URI MUST subsequently return a 404 Not Found


6.8 Retrieving the Statement

The Statement can be found either embedded as foreign markup inside the Deposit Receipt, or can be retrieved by
requesting the URI provided in the atom:link@rel="http://purl.org/net/sword/terms/statement" element.  The format
of the statement is identified by the "type" attribute of the atom:link@rel="http://purl.org/net/sword/terms/statement"
element and MAY be "application/rdf+xml" for an OAI-ORE Resource Map, or "application/atom+xml;type=feed" for an
Atom Feed.

For details on these serialisations see Section XXX: SWORD Statement


7. Packaging

AtomPub uses the MIME mechanism to describe the data encoding for resources. This mechanism is inadequate where compound
types are involved, such as tar archive files, METS packages, SCORM packages, MPEG21 DIDL packages etc. For example, a
server might support certain METS profiles but not others. Other servers might be agnostic towards packaging, but
support only certain contents within an archive.

In order to support package deposit and retrieval, SWORD uses the mechanisms described in [SWORD002] to extend AtomPub.

7.1 Package support in Service description

The SWORD Service Document uses the sword:acceptPackaging element from [SWORD002] to indicate that a SWORD collection will
accept deposits of a particular packaging format.

Clients should refer to the sword:treatment description in the Service Document to find out the treatment for a particular
packaging type.

Packages formats SHOULD be identified by a URI (as per [SWORD002]), and MAY be identified by a URI from the SWORD
package registry (see [SWORD0005]).

     <sword:acceptPackaging>http://purl.org/net/sword/package/BagIt</sword:acceptPackaging>
   </collection>

 </workspace>
</service>

7.2 Package support during resource creation

When creating Media Resources, the client SHOULD indicate the archive file MIME type using the
HTTP "Content-Type" header, and SHOULD also give information about content packaging using the Packaging HTTP header [SWORD001]
(See Section XXX for details).

The value of the Packaging header SHOULD match one of values the server has advertised as acceptable for the collection
in the manner described in Section 7.1.

If a server receives a POST with an unacceptable Packaging header value, it MUST reject the POST by returning an HTTP
response with a status code of 415 (Unsupported Media Type), or store the content without further processing (as
per [SWORD001]).

7.3 Package description in entry documents

When describing packaged resources in Media Entry documents, servers MUST use the atom:content@type attribute to
describe the MIME type of the resource, and MAY add sword:packaging elements to the entry.

If the server does not supply any sword:packaging elements, the client MUST assume that the server only supports the
default packaging format [SWORD005].

7.4 Example

  </entry>

7.5 Registering packaging types under the sword namespace

Clients and servers SHOULD use URIs to communicate about package types, and MAY use URIs registered in the SWORD
Package Registry [SWORD005].  To register a new URI in the SWORD Package Registry, follow the instructions laid out
in [SWORD005].  Registration of package URIs in the SWORD Package Registry is strictly optional.

8. Authentication and Mediated Deposit

In [AtomPub] section 14, implementations MUST support HTTP Basic Authentication in conjunction with a TLS connection.
The SWORD Profile relaxes this requirement: SWORD client and server implementations SHOULD be capable of being
configured to use HTTP Basic Authentication [RFC2617] in conjunction with a TLS connection as specified by [RFC2818].

In a number of situations the authenticated user using a SWORD client is not the owner of the deposited resource.
SWORD provides a way of representing this usage by allowing clients to set a HTTP header field On-Behalf-Of which,
if present SHOULD contain a user principle for the owner of the resource. It is also possible to use this SWORD mediation
mechanism for situations such as non-interactive batch deposit in which the authenticated user is a software acting on
behalf of a user. 

The mediation technique described by SWORD is not intrinsically secure - it is assumed that trust between the owning
user and the mediating user will be established by extending SWORD, or outside the scope of a resource creation, using
a mechanism such as that described by [OAUTH].

8.1 Mediation In Service Description

SWORD servers SHOULD indicate whether they support mediated deposit by including a sword:mediation element containing a
text element of either "true" or "false" in app:collection elements in Service Documents (see Section XXX).

Clients SHOULD use the On-Behalf-Of header when retrieving Service Documents if they intend to use the feature for
resource creation. Servers MAY use this header information along with authentication and any other information in
constructing the Service Document representation returned. For example, the server might include only collections to
which theOn-Behalf-Of can deposit.

8.2 Recording Depositing Users

In all cases (mediated or not) where a user has authenticated to make a deposit, servers SHOULD preserve the user's identity
in the sword:depositedBy property of the SWORD Statement. In mediated deposit, the value given in the
On-Behalf-Of header SHOULD be used for the value of the sword:depositedOnBehalfOf property of the SWORD Statement.
