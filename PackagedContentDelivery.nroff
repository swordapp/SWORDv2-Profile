Abstract

Often in information systems there is a requirement to move content between applications and servers in groups of files and associated metadata.  This document describes HTTP Headers and Media Features to aid this process over HTTP.

1  Introduction

This specification describes HTTP headers and Media Features to enhance the delivery of packaged content over HTTP to document servers and similar systems from client software.

.ti 0
1.1  Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

.ti 0
1.2 Notation

The version of BNF used in this document is taken from [RFC2068], and many of the nonterminals used are defined there.  Note that the underlying charset is US-ASCII.

.ti 0
2  Packaging

The Packaging header is constructed as follows:


	Packaging = "Packaging" ":" packaging-expression

	packaging-expression = token | quoted-string | absoluteURI

Note that token, quoted-string and absoluteURI are defined in [RFC2068].

For example:

	Packaging: http://purl.org/net/terms/package/default

.ti 0
2.1 During HTTP POST or HTTP PUT

The Packaging request header SHOULD be used by the user agent during HTTP POST to give information to the server about the packaging format used to construct the content being POSTed or PUT.  Servers SHOULD use this information to unpack the supplied content into its component parts.  If the server does not understand the package format it MUST either store the content as delivered without unpacking or respond with 415 (Unsupported Media Type).

.ti 0
2.2 During HTTP GET

The Packaging request header SHOULD be used by the user agent during HTTP GET to indicate to the server the package format that the content identified by the URI should be returned in.  Servers MUST either return the content in the specified format or return a 406 Not Acceptable.

.ti 0
3 On-Behalf-Of

The On-Behalf-Of request header MAY be used by the user agent to alert the server as to the identity of the true owner of the content during PUT, POST, DELETE and GET.  Traditional HTTP authentication is insufficient in this regard as it is possible that content will be delivered machine-to-machine and the authenticating user will be the user agent not the content owner.  Servers SHOULD use this information to determine whether and how they accept the content.

	On-Behalf-Of = "On-Behalf-Of" ":" (token | quoted-string)

For example:

	Authorization: Basic [digested auth information for user agent]

	On-Behalf-Of: jbloggs

.ti 0
4 In-Progress

The In-Progress request header MAY be used by the user agent to inform the server that the current content payload is not yet complete in some unspecified way during PUT, POST or DELETE.  For example, there may by further content packages that the user agent plans to deliver to the server before the full content has been delivered, or the user agent may need to carry out other actions against the server before confirming that the server can proceed to fully process the content.  Exact interpretation of this header is left to the server, so it is necessary that server/client pairs will have to have a common understanding of its meaning which is beyond the scope of this document.

	In-Progress = "In-Progress" ":" ("true" | "false")

.ti 0
6 Suppress-Metadata

The Suppress-Metadata request header MAY be used by the user agent to instruct the server not to attempt to extract metadata from the supplied content package, during PUT, POST or DELETE.  Content packages commonly contain both file content and metadata about its contents, and during unpacking servers may process this metadata in a way which is meaningful to them.  This directive allows the user agent to suppress that behaviour for its own purposes.  Furthermore, a DELETE operation may be requested which removes content previously delivered from the server, and in this case the header instructs the server to retain a copy of the metadata while deleting the content.

	Suppress-Metadata = "Suppress-Metadata" ":" ("true" | "false")

7  Security Considerations

This document is based on HTTP and thus subject to the security considerations found in Section 15 of [RFC2068].


.ti 0
8  IANA Considerations

This document specifies 5 new message headers which conform to the registry mechanism for provisional message headers in [RFC3864] and one new media feature which conforms to the URI tree registry mechanism in [RFC2506].
