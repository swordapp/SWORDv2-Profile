SWORD 004    Atom Multipart Extensions for Packaged Content January 2011


Abstract

   The AtomPub Multipart Media Resource Creation Internet Draft
   [AtomMultipart] defines how an Atom Publishing Protocol collection
   may process multipart/related requests and how a service announces
   that it accepts multipart/related entities.  This document adds a
   short additional extension to that draft for supporting the delivery
   of packaged content in the same way.

SWORD 004    Atom Multipart Extensions for Packaged Content January 2011


1  Introduction

   This specification defines a set of extensions to the Atom Publishing
   Protocol [RFC5023] to support the transfer and recovery of content in
   scholarly systems.  We will refer to a service which complies to this
   extension to AtomPub a SWORD server throughout the course of this
   document.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2 Namespaces

   All extensions are defined within the namespace:

       http://purl.org/net/sword/

   This document uses the prefix "sword" for the namespace name.

   The AtomPub namespace is:

       http://www.w3.org/2007/app

   This document uses the prefix "app" for the namespace name.

   The Atom Syndication Format namespace is:

       http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom

   This document uses the prefix "atom" for the namespace name.

2  Multipart Representations Extensions

   This section documents extensions to the Multipart Representations of
   the deposit.

   Further to the requirements laid out in [AtomMultipart] the Entry
   Part MUST include a Content-Disposition header of type "attachment"
   and name parameter of "atom":

   	Content-Disposition: attachment; name=atom

   The Media Part MUST include a Content-Disposition header of type
   "attachment" and name parameter of "payload".  It MAY also include a
   filename parameter:
